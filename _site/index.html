    <h3>Background</h3>

<p>I’ve been working in a software shop that uses Mac machines for all our dev machines for about 3 months now. Prior to this, I had some experience with the Unix environment, but had never done anything with bash scripts to make my life easier. I had absolutely no idea what I was missing.</p>

<h3>Slow Start</h3>

<p>Less than two weeks into the job, I realized that typing out full branch names to checkout a branch was absolutely terrible and went through the process of setting up <a href="http://code-worrier.com/blog/autocomplete-git/">git-completion.bash</a>, which I found extremely helpful, but that was the extent of my quality of life improvements for a while.</p>

<p>About a month later, I realized I could alias commands in  <code>~/.bash_profile</code>. I’m more than a little ashamed of the fact that it took me so long to set up anything to help myself out, but I was finally getting it. I quickly set up a command to use psql and connect to our database.</p>

<h3>The Good Stuff</h3>

<p>Today, I finally went through the process of making my life a lot easier. I set up lots of basic shortcuts to make git commands quicker and speed up things I was doing all day anyway. Then I finally realized I could do a lot better for myself.  One of the functions I set up was a shorthand for doing checkouts.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span></span><span class="k">function</span> co<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    git checkout <span class="nv">$1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This could be used to checkout branches quickly with <code>co &lt;branch_name&gt;</code>. I also set up the functions <code>nb</code> and <code>db</code> that used a similar structure to create and delete branches.</p>

<p>I then realized that my solution could do more. Git branch tab auto-completion is great, but what if I could do better? Our branches at work all have their JIRA ticket number in the name, followed by a description. I decided to make a function to search on a string provided and checkout the matching branch.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span></span><span class="k">function</span> cbb<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="nv">branch</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sb">`</span>git branch —list *<span class="nv">$1</span>*<span class="p">;</span><span class="sb">`</span>
    git checkout <span class="nv">$branch</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I used the shorthand cbb for &#39;checkout bug branch&#39;, but really the shorthand doesn’t matter. You can make it anything short that&#39;s easy to remember.</p>

<p>My intended use for this was to use the JIRA ticket number with the checkout function, but it can be applied to any matching string. For example, I would have a branch name <code>web_9999_test_branch</code> for example. To check it out with our new script, we just need to run <code>cbb 9999</code> and our branch will be checked out.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>There’s also room for some improvement here on the string matching for multiple matches and allowing the user to select one and potentially prompting the user for a new branch name if no result is found, but I’ll leave that for another post.</p>
